GraphQL:	A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility over traditional REST APIs.
Docker:	A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development and deployment.
GitHub	:A platform for version control and team collaboration, where source code is stored, reviewed, and managed through Git.
GitHub: Actions	A CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub to automate testing, building, and deploying the application.
Markdown:	A lightweight markup language used to create structured documentation such as the README.md file and other project-related guides.

# Feature Breakdown
User Management
Handles user registration, login, and role-based access (e.g., guest or host). Implements secure authentication and password hashing to protect user credentials and manage sessions.

🏘️ Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes location, pricing, and availability details. This feature enables the core supply-side functionality of the platform.

📅 Booking System
Enables users to search for available properties and make bookings based on check-in/check-out dates. Prevents overlapping reservations and ensures smooth coordination between users and property availability.

🌟 Reviews & Ratings
Guests can rate their stays and leave reviews for properties. Hosts can view feedback to improve their offerings, and new guests can use reviews to make informed decisions.

💳 Payment Integration
Processes and records payments for bookings. Includes support for payment status tracking and links payments to specific reservations, ensuring a complete transactional workflow.

🛡️ API Security
Implements secure authentication (e.g., JWT), request validation, and role-based permissions to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to resources.

⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
Uses GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This ensures faster iterations, fewer manual errors, and reliable delivery of new features.

📚 Project Documentation
Comprehensive documentation in Markdown format, including database schema, API endpoints, and setup instructions. This promotes transparency, maintainability, and team collaboration.
# API Security Overview
1. Authentication
Description: Uses secure login methods (e.g., JWT or token-based authentication) to verify the identity of users before granting access to protected resources.

Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only registered users can interact with their accounts or make bookings.

2. Authorization
Description: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to define permissions for guests, hosts, and admins.

Why it matters: Restricts actions based on user roles—for example, only hosts can manage listings, and only the booking owner can cancel a reservation.

3. Input Validation & Sanitization
Description: Ensures that all incoming data (from forms, URLs, and APIs) is properly validated and sanitized.

Why it matters: Prevents common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and data corruption.

4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Description: Limits the number of API requests per user/IP address within a specific timeframe.

Why it matters: Protects the system against brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS), and abuse of endpoints.

5. Data Encryption
Description: Uses HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for secure data transmission and applies password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) for storing credentials.

Why it matters: Protects sensitive data (like login info and payment details) from being intercepted or stolen during transmission or from the database.

6. Secure Payment Handling
Description: Ensures payment processing is performed through trusted, PCI-compliant third-party services and stores only transaction references, not card data.

Why it matters: Protects users' financial information and maintains legal compliance for handling payments.

7. Error Handling & Logging
Description: Hides sensitive information in error messages and logs suspicious activity for later analysis.

Why it matters: Prevents attackers from learning system internals while helping developers identify and resolve security threats. 

# CI/CD Pipeline Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are essential DevOps practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. In the Airbnb Clone Project, CI/CD pipelines help ensure that every change pushed to the repository is automatically verified and safely deployed.

🔄 Why It Matters:
Improves Code Quality: Automated testing detects bugs early and ensures code reliability before deployment.

Accelerates Development: Reduces manual steps and speeds up the release cycle by automating build, test, and deployment tasks.

Minimizes Downtime: Automated pipelines reduce human error, making deployments more predictable and stable.

Encourages Collaboration: Makes it easier for multiple team members to contribute and merge changes with confidence.

🛠️ Tools Used:
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for testing and deployment directly from your GitHub repository.

Docker: Ensures the application runs consistently across different environments by containerizing services.

(Optional) Heroku / AWS / Railway: Can be used as deployment platforms to host the application and manage release pipelines.
