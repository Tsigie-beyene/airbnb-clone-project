# The Airbnb Clone Project 

## 🚀 Project Overview

# airbnb-clone-project
is a backend-focused Airbnb Clone project built to simulate a real-world booking platform. This project provides a robust foundation for managing users, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payment transactions — mimicking the core features of Airbnb with scalable, secure, and modern backend architecture.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure registration, login, and user profile control.
- **Property Management**: Listing, updating, and retrieving property data.
- **Booking System**: Booking creation, updates, and tracking reservations.
- **Payment Processing**: Seamless and secure handling of transactions.
- **Review System**: Enable users to review and rate properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Enhanced performance via indexing and caching.

## 🗃️ Database Design

### Key Entities and Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`, `email`, `username`, `password`, `is_host`
- **Properties**
  - `id`, `host_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`
- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`
- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`

### Relationships

- A **user** can list multiple **properties**.
- A **booking** is linked to one **property** and one **user**.
- A **payment** is associated with one **booking**.
- A **review** is linked to both a **user** and a **property**.

---

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  - Users can register, authenticate, and update their profiles securely.
- **Property Management**
  - Hosts can list new properties and manage existing listings.
- **Booking System**
  - Users can book available properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**
  - Integrates payment workflows to process and record transactions.
- **Review System**
  - Enables users to provide feedback and rate properties.
- **Database Optimization**
  - Implements indexing and caching for efficient performance.

---

## 🔐 API Security

To ensure data protection and secure operations, the following measures are implemented:

- **Authentication**: Secure user login and token-based access.
- **Authorization**: Only authorized users can access or modify specific resources.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects APIs from abuse and brute-force attacks.
- **Data Validation**: Prevents injection attacks and invalid inputs.
- **Secure Payments**: Ensures safe handling of sensitive transaction data.

Security is essential to protect **user identities**, **financial transactions**, and **personal data**.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates software delivery, ensuring that code changes are tested, integrated, and deployed with minimal human intervention.

### Tools Used:

- **GitHub Actions**: For building, testing, and deploying the backend application.
- **Docker**: Standardizes environments for development and deployment.
- **Celery & Redis**: Support asynchronous job processing and real-time workflows.

## 📈 API Documentation Overview

### REST API (Django REST Framework)

| Endpoint                  | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/users/`                 | Register and list users                          |
| `/users/{user_id}/`       | Retrieve, update, or delete a specific user      |
| `/properties/`            | List, create, update, delete properties          |
| `/bookings/`              | Manage bookings                                  |
| `/payments/`              | Process payments                                 |
| `/reviews/`               | Create, retrieve, update, and delete reviews     |

### GraphQL API

GraphQL enables clients to fetch exactly what they need. Documentation includes types, queries, and mutations for users, properties, bookings, and reviews.
